# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created to visualize the number of internet users across the world from random users API.\
This project uses react boostrap table to visualize the data in a table format + a pie chart from react chart js 2.\
While hovering the Pie slices, you can set the custom text as written in the code.\
Also, when you strike a specific country in legend, the chart will omit that country's data and show the rest.\
